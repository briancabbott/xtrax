# xtrax
A science, innovation, and personal activity tracking platform - something that I want for myself, tracking various
sometimes related and non-related points of interest as well as my own activity and productivity, open sourced and
opened data.

## Stack:
For now, for the foreseeable future ... indefinitely -- A Clojure Stack (Datomic, CLJ, CLJS, etc) Project.
   - 100% Clojure
   - Any 'legacy' (the stuff I have scattered around in isolated execution) data-source providers, re-write in Clojure.
     This is also a Clojure-stack demonstration Project as much as it is XTrax - the purpose is XTrax functionality
     but, the spirit, the essence, the ethos, is Pure Absolute Clojure and to then achieve the rendition in the most
     beautiful Clojure available in my mind at that moment -- implying, yes, to rework component as new Clojure skills
     are gained and, an artistic expression is achieved.



## Operations:
I want to have two modes of operating and, not a partial and a full but, full full => Local and Cloud. Perhaps, we
could have local-full and local-dev for dev specific kinds of required operation that isnt running a full pipeline
(which in debugging scenarios might be undesirable).

   - local-full
   - local-dev
   - cloud-full
