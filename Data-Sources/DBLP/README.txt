In the eyes of DBLP, a simple note refering to DBLP and/or a link back to DBLP's
website is sufficient to meet the attribution criterion. Individual use of only
a small number of records (such as  a publication list of a few authors or the
table of content of a proceedings volume) does not need  attribution. Of course,
we are always happy if you link to us.


2. Terms of Use and Disclaimer

The DBLP team puts much effort into guaranteeing that this web service is as

precluded that there are flaws, errors, inconsitencies, and missing entries in
the provided data. No liability whatsoever shall be assumed for claims following
from material or immaterial damage or loss as the result of the use of or the
inability to use our data, or the use of erroneous or incomplete data, unless
premeditation or gross negligence on the part of DBLP can be demonstrated. Your

In DBLP, brand, product and company names are used without mentioning eventual
existing patents, gebrauchsmuster, or trademark rights, as it is the customary
practice in scientific bibliographies. The use without mentioning existing patents,
gebrauchsmuster, or trademarks does not give reason for the assumption, a brand or
tradename is free of such rights. All protected brands, products or company names
mentioned are the trademarks of their respective owners.

The web service provided by DBLP includes hyperlinks to third-party websites.
Only hyperlinks to websites are included whose content, in our fair judgment,
does not violate applicable law at the time of inclusion. However, we do not have
any influence on the content of third-party websites. Despite careful examination
and taking every precaution, we assume no liability whatsoever for the past,
present, or future content of third-party websites. The content of linked websites
is the sole responsibility of the authors of these websites. If you have the
certain knowledge that a linked third-party website violates applicable law,
please let us know. We will take care that such hyperlinks are removed.

These terms are part of the web service provided by DBLP. If a provision of these
terms is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that
shall not affect the validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any
other provision of these terms; or the validity or enforceability in other
jurisdictions of that or any other provision of these terms.
