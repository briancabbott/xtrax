Set of scripts to facilitate project synchronization and mirroring

The scripts require Python 3 and they rely on a binary/symlink `python3` to be
present that points to the latest Python 3.x version present on the system.

See https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/wiki/Repository-synchronization
for more details.
