# How to configure ${docNameCap}

Before you use ${docNameCap}, you need to set some configuration settings.
There are actually three levels to configure the tool behavior:

1. On a build system integration level. This is done in the [Tool Configuration](tool-configuration.html).
2. On a tool behavior level. This is done in the [Workflow Configuration](workflow-configuration.html).
3. On a data level. This is done in the [config.xml](config-configuration.html).
